## The Jump to Dashboard Plugin 

The JTD plugin is officially Sisense-supported; documentation can be found here - https://www.sisense.com/marketplace/jump-to-dashboard/.

You always need a widget script on the source widget that defines how a user can use that widget to jump to a target dashboard; the documentation contains instructions for creating those.

The *other* scripts in this section enable you to extend / modify Jump to Dashboard functionality in various ways, depending on the desired outcome.
