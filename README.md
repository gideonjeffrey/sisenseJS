# sisenseJS
A collection of dashboard and widget scripts for use in the powerful business intelligence / analytics tool Sisense.  If there's something here that looks helpful, please use it!

A few notes:

1. Obviously you'll have to have your own Sisense account and designer / admin access to apply these widget and dashboard scripts.  

2. Each script will contain commented text that indicates the version of Sisense it has been tested on.  Sisense architecture can change over time from version to version, sometimes significantly, and it's possible that any given script might not perform as intended on your dashboard.

To find up-to-date information on Sisense developer tools, in particular the JavaScript API, go to [Sisense Developers][1].
